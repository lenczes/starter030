    <h1>When to Pull From GitHub?</h1>
    <p>When should you <strong>pull</strong> code from your repository, and why?</p>
    <p>When you have been working on a local copy of your project on your computer, and someone modifies the remote repository before you execute your next run, commit, push  Git commands.</p>
    <p>The conflict happens when you try to run the <strong>git push -u origin master</strong> command.  This will check the files in the GitHub repo and look at any files that have been changed. If you are commit changes to files that have been commited to by someone else (or if you modify files through the GitHub website interface)</p>
